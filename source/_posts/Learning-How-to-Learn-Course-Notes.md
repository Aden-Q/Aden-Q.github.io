This is a [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) on Coursera, taught by Barbara Oakley, and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. The course comprises four modules that introduce how our brain functions, along with severa very useful learning techniques that can be be applied to all disciplines, not only STEM. The insights from the course are based on solid research from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and contributions from leading instructors and practioners in different disciplines. It is a general learning-focused course with a lifelong impact on many people. There is also a career-focus course on Coursera, Mindshift, by the same instructors, which can be seen as a sequel to this course.

## What is Learning?

### Thinking Modes
Researchers found that we have two fundamentally different modes of thinking:
+ Focused mode
+ Diffuse mode

**Focused mode**, as its name suggests, is a mode that is activated when we concentrate intently on something that we are trying to learn or understand.

**Diffuse mode**, on the other hand, turns out to be a relaxed thinking style

An analogy of the pinball game can be used to help us understand how these two different modes function.

On the left, it shows the focused mode. The orange pattern shown at the top represents a familiar thought pattern, such as adding some numbers. Using this mode, we are able to solve problems and understand concepts that are related to something we are rather familiar with. However, when it comes to innovation and creativity. This mode of thinking cannot be of much help. That's when the diffuse mode plays its role.

The diffuse mode, as shown on the right, can help us look at things broadly and make new neural connections traveling along new pathways.

It is worth noting that two thinking modes are mutually exclusive, which means we cannot reside in both modes at the same time. However, it is possible to transfer from one to the other.

### Procrastination and the Pomodora Technique
Procrastination is natural and common. When people look at something that they really would rather not do, they activate the areas of their brain associated with pain. In reaction, the brain will try to stop the negative stimulation by switching attention to something else. That is the cause of procrastination.

However, researchers found that not long after people start actually working on what they didn't like, the neurodiscomfort disappears. Based on this fact, a mental tool called the **Pomodoro** can be effective in helping us tackle procrastication. All it involves is a 25-minute focus period without any interruption, followed by a 5-minute break (to change your focus for a while). Keep in mind that a 25-minute focus is effective for most people, but not everyone. Some people may find a longer time period of focus suits them better (e.g. 50-minute focus + 10-minute break).

### Memory
There are two major memory systems:
+ Short-term memory (aka working memory)
+ Long-term memory

Working memory is like an inefficient mental blackboard. It's centered in the prefrontal cortex and deals with what we're immediately and consciously processing in our minds. Repetitions are needed in order to keep things in working memory.

Long-term memory is like a storage warehouse, distributed over a large area. Different kinds of long-term memory are stored in different regions of the brain.

Practice and repetition help move information from working memory into long-term memory.

However, there's also a trick to repetition. A technique called "Spaced Repetition" is useful and efficient. The idea is to space the repetition out and repeat it over a number of days. Research has shown that repeating something 20 times in one evening is far less effective than practicing it the same number of times over several days.

### The importance of sleep in learning
Sleep is important in learning, in a few aspects.

Being awake generates toxic byproducts in our brain, and sleep plays a crucial role in eliminating these poisons.

Persistently getting too little sleep over an extended period can be associated with adverse conditions such as headaches, depression, heart disease, diabetes, and a higher risk of premature death.

During sleep, our brain tidies up ideas and concepts. It erases less important ideas and strengthens areas that we need or want to remember. It also consolidates our memory into easier to grasp chunks.

It's effective to review what we've learned right before we take a nap or go to sleep for the evening. Dreaming about what we're studying can substantially enhance our ability to understand.

## Chunking
Chunks are compact packages of informaton that our mind can easily access. Building chunks can help build a good knowledge foundation for a difficult displine.
