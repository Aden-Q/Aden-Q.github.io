This is a [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) on Coursera, taught by Barbara Oakley, and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. The course comprises four modules that introduce how our brain functions, along with severa very useful learning techniques that can be be applied to all disciplines, not only STEM. The insights from the course are based on solid research from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and contributions from leading instructors and practioners in different disciplines. It is a general learning-focused course with a lifelong impact on many people. There is also a career-focus course on Coursera, Mindshift, by the same instructors, which can be seen as a sequel to this course.

## What is Learning?

### Thinking Modes
Researchers found that we have two fundamentally different modes of thinking:
+ Focused mode
+ Diffuse mode

**Focused mode**, as its name suggests, is a mode that is activated when we concentrate intently on something that we are trying to learn or understand.

**Diffuse mode**, on the other hand, turns out to be a relaxed thinking style

An analogy of the pinball game can be used to help us understand how these two different modes function.

On the left, it shows the focused mode. The orange pattern shown at the top represents a familiar thought pattern, such as adding some numbers. Using this mode, we are able to solve problems and understand concepts that are related to something we are rather familiar with. However, when it comes to innovation and creativity. This mode of thinking cannot be of much help. That's when the diffuse mode plays its role.

The diffuse mode, as shown on the right, can help us look at things broadly and make new neural connections traveling along new pathways.

It is worth noting that two thinking modes are mutually exclusive, which means we cannot reside in both modes at the same time. However, it is possible to transfer from one to the other.

### Procrastination and the Pomodora Technique
Procrastination is natural and common. When people look at something that they really would rather not do, they activate the areas of their brain associated with pain. In reaction, the brain will try to stop the negative stimulation by switching attention to something else. That is the cause of procrastination.

However, researchers found that not long after people start actually working on what they didn't like, the neurodiscomfort disappears. Based on this fact, a mental tool called the **Pomodoro** can be effective in helping us tackle procrastication. All it involves is a 25-minute focus period without any interruption, followed by a 5-minute break. Keep in mind that a 25-minute focus is effective for most people, but not everyone. Some people may find a longer time period of focus suits them better.
